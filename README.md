# portfolio-website

This is my portfolio website, made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I got the domain from Namecheap and use Firebase to host the domain. 
This website is a basic web page. There are a lot of things I can do to upgrade this website but I will continue in the future

This is the domain of the website: 

gbhoang.me
portfolio-website-e8963.web.app

If you cannot access it with the first, try the second one. The domain verification step is a bit complicated and I am still trying to figure it out.
